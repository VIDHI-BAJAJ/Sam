{"product_id":"ingeborg-lounge-chair-sheepskin","title":"Ingeborg Lounge Chair, Sheepskin","description":"\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eNamed after the designer’s artist mother, Ingeborg Winding, the Ingeborg Lounge Chair from 1940 welcomes the sitter with open arms and an irresistibly charming expression. The lounge design features elegant sculptural armrests and an angled frame for comfort. Despite the chair’s petite stature, Ingeborg makes a strong statement in any room. Beautiful from every angle, it fits effortlessly into a given space without taking up too much room. Originally designed with sheepskin upholstery, Ingeborg is today reworked from original archival drawings and available in a range of upholstery fabrics and with natural or dark-oiled oak heartwood legs. The chair pairs beautifully with the corresponding sofa.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Flemming Lassen","offers":[{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Sheepskin Moonlight","offer_id":40152756355138,"sku":"1500207-010E02ZZ","price":5370.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Sheepskin Honey","offer_id":40152756387906,"sku":"1500207-010G02ZZ","price":5370.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Sheepskin Sahara","offer_id":40152756420674,"sku":"1500207-010J02ZZ","price":5370.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dark Stained Oak \/ Sheepskin Moonlight","offer_id":40152756453442,"sku":"1500207-040E02ZZ","price":5370.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dark Stained Oak \/ Sheepskin Honey","offer_id":40152756486210,"sku":"1500207-040G02ZZ","price":5370.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dark Stained Oak \/ Sheepskin Sahara","offer_id":40152756518978,"sku":"1500207-040J02ZZ","price":5370.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/files\/Audo_Ingeborg_LoungeChair_Ottoman_Sheep_Moonlight_Stance_Vase_1.jpg?v=1697025142","url":"https:\/\/audocph.com\/products\/ingeborg-lounge-chair-sheepskin","provider":"Audo Copenhagen","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
