{"product_id":"my-own-chair","title":"My Own Chair","description":"\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eDesigned by Flemming Lassen in 1938, My Own Chair is an original and eye-catching piece of mid-century Danish modern design. Upon launch it received much praise for its sculptural form with distinctive wings, yet its complex two-part silhouette made it unsuitable for mass production until the advent of modern techniques. Its lumbar supportive, rounded, angled seat and extended backrest cocoon the sitter in comfort. Wooden legs and expert upholstery complete the design. A corresponding footrest adds to the sense of ease. Said to be Lassen’s favourite chair, it stood at the designer’s home until his death in 1984.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Flemming Lassen","offers":[{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Sheepskin Moonlight","offer_id":40190269063234,"sku":"1500907-010E02ZZ","price":9420.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Walnut \/ Sheepskin Moonlight","offer_id":40130030600258,"sku":"1501107-020E02ZZ","price":9420.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/files\/Audo_My_Own_Chair_13_WEB.jpg?v=1692262008","url":"https:\/\/audocph.com\/products\/my-own-chair","provider":"Audo Copenhagen","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
