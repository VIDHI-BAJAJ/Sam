Conceived in collaboration with Norm Architects and Els Van Hoorebeeck, the Co Bar\/Counter Chair is shaped with a wide back and generous seat and is set on a slender yet sturdy tubular steel frame. Equal parts comfortable and elegant, the versatile design is available in two versions, counter and bar, allowing you to select the height that best suits your needs.
