{"product_id":"hana-vase","title":"Hana Vase","description":"\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eHana is inspired by ikebana, the ancient Japanese art of flower arranging that uses few but carefully chosen and artfully positioned stems. Shaped around a central ceramic flower frog, or kenzan, Hana lets you create foolproof floral displays, holding flower stalks and branches in place at different angles. The kenzan can be removed for a more traditional arrangement. Designed in Copenhagen by Krøyer-Sætter-Lassen, the vase is available in three sizes in three unique finishes.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Kroyer-Saetter-Lassen","offers":[{"title":"H7 \/ Umber","offer_id":40122400178242,"sku":"4827979","price":105.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"H14.5 \/ Ochre","offer_id":40122400211010,"sku":"4828419","price":55.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"H26 \/ Ashen","offer_id":40122400243778,"sku":"4829659","price":200.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/MENU_Hana_Vase.jpg?v=1671613509","url":"https:\/\/audocph.com\/products\/hana-vase","provider":"Audo Copenhagen","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
