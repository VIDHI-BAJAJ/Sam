{"product_id":"corbel-desk-1","title":"Corbel Desk","description":"\u003cp\u003eDesigned to seamlessly transition into home settings, catering to remote work and the need for stylish yet functional home office furniture, the Corbel Wall Desk delivers a flexible, space-saving solution particularly beneficial for smaller spaces. The shelf takes its name and design cues from architectural weight-bearing brackets traditionally made from stone or wood. This inspiration infuses the design with a sense of structural elegance. Designed with a small distance to the wall for neat cord management, solid wood edges enhance the table top's durability, while the smooth linoleum desk surface contributes to a practical and professional workspace. The wall-mounted design can be paired with the series shelf to create a minimalist home office setup.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eÂ \u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Kroyer-Saetter-Lassen","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":47656457732426,"sku":"7093840","price":590.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/files\/Audo_Co_Task_Chair_Corbel_Desk_Reverse_Table_Lamp_23.jpg?v=1708509485","url":"https:\/\/audocph.com\/products\/corbel-desk-1","provider":"Audo Copenhagen","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
