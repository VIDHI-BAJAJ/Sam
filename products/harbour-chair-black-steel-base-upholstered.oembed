Designed specifically for Audo House, the dining chair is ideal for anything from restaurants, conferences, offices, or in the comfort of one’s own home. A hybrid space that mixes office, showroom, café and restaurant in one, Audo House required a chair that could suit a range of purposes. Finding a perfect balance between geometry and organic shapes, the shell’s armrests bend outwards for maximum support, as does its high backrest, providing not only comfort, but also an elegant and slim appearance that will appeal to any discerning design aficionado.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e All Harbour Chairs have been upgraded with extra foam in the seat for better sitting comfort, increasing from 15 mm in thickness to 25 mm.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Norm Architects","offers":[{"title":"Black | Dakar - 0842","offer_id":32294966067266,"sku":"9341004-002E05ZZ","price":1155.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Black | Remix - 233","offer_id":32294966132802,"sku":"9341001-000N0BZZ","price":710.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/MENU_Harbour-dining-Chair-uphosltered-black-steel.jpg?v=1678873571","url":"https:\/\/audocph.com\/products\/harbour-chair-black-steel-base-upholstered","provider":"Audo Copenhagen","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
