{"product_id":"tearoom-lounge-chair","title":"Tearoom, Lounge Chair","description":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTimeless in its expression and execution, the Tearoom Collection is well-suited to both period and contemporary environments. Like the Tearoom Club Chair, the Tearoom Lounge Chair and Tearoom Sofa radiate elegant yet strict femininity. Their embracing form, while alluring, stops short of being overly casual. As such, the furniture maintains a clear visual connection to the sculptural 1904 Willow Chair that originally sparked the designer’s imagination The Tearoom Lounge Chair and Tearoom Sofa join the Tearoom Club Chair to complete the leisure experience in a multitude of settings, from exclusive hotels, clubs and lounges to private homes. Pairing the luxurious feel of full upholstery with a clean silhouette rooted in geometric forms, the Tearoom Collection is as appealing to the touch as it is easy on the eyes. While creating the clean silhouette, Ross took exceptional care to imbue every inch with mood-lifting comfort. Every design element curves gently to ensure that the furniture’s contours complement our own. Beneath the upholstery, a wood and foam construction creates the ideal pairing of sturdiness and lush comfort.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Nick Ross","offers":[{"title":"Savanna - 202","offer_id":31864572608578,"sku":"9605002-002B09ZZ","price":2780.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Champion - 035","offer_id":39247079669826,"sku":"9605001-00AH00ZZ","price":2430.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Doppiopanama 001","offer_id":39251948077122,"sku":"9605008-000203ZZ","price":3490.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Audo Bouclé 02","offer_id":39348861698114,"sku":"9605020-000300ZZ","price":2185.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/MENU_Tearoom_Louge_Chair_2.jpg?v=1697193853","url":"https:\/\/audocph.com\/products\/tearoom-lounge-chair","provider":"Audo Copenhagen","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
