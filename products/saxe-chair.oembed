{"product_id":"saxe-chair","title":"Saxe Chair","description":"\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eMogens Lassenâ€™s Saxe Chair is a tried-and-true example of how aesthetics and function go hand in hand. Despite being regarded as a rebel, Mogens Lassen aimed for perfection in each of his design projects. His eye for detail, leaving nothing to chance, and his determination to break new ground are visible on his timeless Saxe Lounge Chair. The leather seat puts the natural material to the test, stretched to perfection across the solid wood frame. The technique was in its early days when the chair was first made in the mid-1900s. Beautiful polished brass fittings underpin the handcrafted feel and add a further sense of luxury to the design.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Mogens Lassen","offers":[{"title":"Oiled Natural Oak | Black Leather","offer_id":40130030403650,"sku":"BL581104","price":2295.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Black Stained Oak | Black Leather","offer_id":40130030469186,"sku":"BL581102","price":2295.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":false},{"title":"Soap Treated Oak | Natural Leather","offer_id":40135192346690,"sku":"BL581101","price":2295.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/Audo_Saxe_Chair_Plinth_Tall_Low_Torso_Table_lamp_57_Eave_Modular_Open_End.jpg?v=1676561278","url":"https:\/\/audocph.com\/products\/saxe-chair","provider":"Audo Copenhagen","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
