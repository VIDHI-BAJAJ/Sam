{"product_id":"oda-lounge-chair","title":"Oda Lounge Chair","description":"\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cspan data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eOriginally dubbed Model 9, the Oda Chair was an ambitious design from the very beginning. Created by Arnold Madsen in around 1956, the aesthetic reinterpretation of an armchair has a complex horseshoe construction with an integrated headrest and beautifully incorporated armrests in wood. Offering comfortable support, the embracing design was initially – and mistakenly – attributed to Nanna Ditzel. In 2020 it was rightfully credited to Madsen. Constructed according to a vintage version as there are no drawings of the original design, the Oda Chair profiles a sublime level of craftsmanship, evident in the intricacy of its upholstery. Available with legs in natural oak or walnut.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Arnold Madsen","offers":[{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Hallingdal 65 0110","offer_id":39793749491778,"sku":"1212002-000000ZZ","price":4440.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Hallingdal 65 200","offer_id":39793749524546,"sku":"1212002-000100ZZ","price":4440.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Hallingdal 65 600","offer_id":40032787398722,"sku":"1212002-000200ZZ","price":4440.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Walnut \/ Hallingdal 65 0110","offer_id":40032786546754,"sku":"1213002-000200ZZ","price":4860.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Walnut \/ Hallingdal 65 200","offer_id":39793749557314,"sku":"1213002-000100ZZ","price":4860.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Walnut \/ Hallingdal 65 600","offer_id":39793749590082,"sku":"1213002-000000ZZ","price":4860.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/MENU_Oda_Lounge_Chair.jpg?v=1654852330","url":"https:\/\/audocph.com\/products\/oda-lounge-chair","provider":"Audo Copenhagen","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
