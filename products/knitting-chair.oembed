{"product_id":"knitting-chair","title":"Knitting Lounge Chair, Leather","description":"\u003cp\u003eThe Knitting Chair by Ib Kofod-Larsen, first launched as a limited edition in 1951, makes a triumphant return to the world of modern Danish design under Audo’s concept of “Modernism Reimagined”. This is the brand’s first foray into classic furniture. The chair’s sense of proportion and unparalleled quality makes it a natural choice to bring into contemporary interiors. The playful nature of the Knitting Chair serves to highlight its thoughtful design. Named for the elbow cut-outs that allow maximum comfort while knitting (or reading), the chair is clearly the work of a master designer.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Ib Kofod-Larsen","offers":[{"title":"Dark Stained Oak | Dakar 0311","offer_id":31864598265922,"sku":"9680004-020600ZZ","price":3490.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Natural Oak | Dunes 21000","offer_id":32321132462146,"sku":"9680005-030D00ZZ","price":3760.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Walnut | Dakar 0842","offer_id":32450582052930,"sku":"9682004-001G00ZZ","price":3850.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/MENU_Knitting-Chair_Plinth_Cyclades_209d209c-1003-46f0-8c02-383e2101e331.jpg?v=1688728439","url":"https:\/\/audocph.com\/products\/knitting-chair","provider":"Audo Copenhagen","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
