{"product_id":"ready-chair-without-upholstery","title":"Ready Dining Chair without upholstery","description":"\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eThe result of a study of the possibilities of form-pressing techniques, Ready Chair, created for Audo by Matias Møllenbach and Nick Rasmussen, takes its cues from classic free-swing chair designs, its cantilevered seat and backrest appearing as if suspended on air. Available in oak veneer, it comes with a natural or red stained oak finish and with the option of an upholstered seat and back. Perfectly sized for use as a dining chair, its stackable design and row-connecting feature make it equally suited to a multitude of other uses.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe Ready Dining Chair can be stacked with 10 chairs with and without the Row Connection.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Matias Møllenbach \u0026 Nick Rasmussen","offers":[{"title":"Natural Oak","offer_id":39333545082946,"sku":"8201100-00ZZZZZZ","price":390.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red Stained Oak","offer_id":39333545115714,"sku":"8201100-01ZZZZZZ","price":390.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Black Painted Oak","offer_id":39810448818242,"sku":"8201100-02ZZZZZZ","price":390.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/MENU_Hashira_Table_Lamp_Portable_Ready_Dining_Chair.jpg?v=1654848356","url":"https:\/\/audocph.com\/products\/ready-chair-without-upholstery","provider":"Audo Copenhagen","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
