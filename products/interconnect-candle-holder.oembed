{"product_id":"interconnect-candle-holder","title":"Interconnect Candle Holder","description":"\u003cp\u003eInterconnect Candle Holder is a bold and illuminating centrepiece of exaggerated proportions, designed for Audo by Colin King. As a source of cosy candlelight, it is characterised by its deceptively simple geometric form: a sphere, an angle and a line, which unite to create a unique design.
