The chair's construction is characterized by an open design, featuring a curved back and seat upholstered in fabric or leather, all held together by a sturdy steel frame. This chair, created by furniture designer Ib Kofod-Larsen in 1953, embodies Danish cultural heritage and design history. With its elegant silhouette, sculptural form, and organic lines and curves, it remains a contemporary masterpiece that resonates even more strongly in the present.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Ib Kofod-Larsen","offers":[{"title":"Re-wool 218","offer_id":46869694284106,"sku":"1231001-000400ZZ","price":1595.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Re-wool 448","offer_id":46869694316874,"sku":"1231001-000800ZZ","price":1595.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Hallingdal 65 0110","offer_id":46869694349642,"sku":"1231002-000200ZZ","price":1635.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Hallingdal 65 600","offer_id":46869694382410,"sku":"1231002-000X00ZZ","price":1635.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dakar 0250","offer_id":46869694415178,"sku":"1231005-000300ZZ","price":1825.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dakar 0329","offer_id":46869694447946,"sku":"1231005-000700ZZ","price":1825.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dakar 0842","offer_id":46869694480714,"sku":"1231005-000T00ZZ","price":1825.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/files\/Audo_Penguin_Rocking_Chair_111_37d70e58-802c-498e-b713-450fec606bab.jpg?v=1691146864","url":"https:\/\/audocph.com\/products\/the-penguin-rocking-chair-fully-upholstered","provider":"Audo Copenhagen","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
