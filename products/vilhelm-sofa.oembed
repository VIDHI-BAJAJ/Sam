{"product_id":"vilhelm-sofa","title":"Vilhelm Sofa","description":"\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eA sleek yet sumptuous three-seater sofa designed by Flemming Lassen in 1935, Vilhelm takes its name from the designerâ€™s father and its design cues from the mid-century movement. Reintroduced in 2019 and updated to modern needs, Vilhelm invites relaxation with its gently rounded form and padded upholstery. The back and armrests offer privacy and are expertly detailed with buttons. Strong in terms of craft and presence, it welcomes life with its functional form.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Flemming Lassen","offers":[{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Zero 0001 | Vegetal Leather Buttons","offer_id":40130029387842,"sku":"1500803-012M05ZZ","price":7475.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dark Stained Oak \/ Grand Mohair 1103","offer_id":40130029355074,"sku":"1500704-040D02ZZ","price":8430.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dark Stained Oak \/ Zero 0001 | Vegetal Leather Buttons","offer_id":40130029420610,"sku":"1500803-042M05ZZ","price":7475.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Grand Mohair 1103","offer_id":40190268276802,"sku":"1500704-010D02ZZ","price":8430.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/MENU_Vilhelm_Sofa_Jager_Lounge_Table_Gravel_Rug_Wing_Floor_Lamp_Releve_Platter.jpg?v=1676561435","url":"https:\/\/audocph.com\/products\/vilhelm-sofa","provider":"Audo Copenhagen","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
