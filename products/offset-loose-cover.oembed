The studio wanted to create a sofa as simply as possible while embracing a set of paradoxes: making it substantial yet delicate in appearance, architectural yet inviting and homey.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eThe Offset Loose Cover introduces increased longevity, functionality and versatility to the collection, with a removable and washable exterior crafted from a custom-made cotton and linen blend textile in three timeless colours. The soft, natural and easy to clean cover creates a relaxed silhouette for the Offset, imbuing spaces with a sense of casual elegance.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eThe internal body of the sofa has an inherently longer life than its cover, which can become worn with time and daily use. By creating a removable cover for the Offset, it is possible to retain the body whilst simply replacing the cover—extending the product’s lifespan and reducing the instance of waste. In this way, the Offset Loose Cover can also adapt to evolving lifestyles, design and colour preferences to be cherished for generations.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eThe frame of the Offset sofa is constructed from wood and the back and side cushions are made from a double foam core encased in a feather down and foam blend for superior comfort and durability. The loose cover is secured to the sofa and armrests in one streamlined piece, with a concealed Velcro strip allowing for convenient removal.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Norm Architects","offers":[{"title":"For 1 Seater \/ Audo Cotlin - Oat","offer_id":39331406708802,"sku":"9852010","price":630.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"For 1 Seater \/ Audo Cotlin - Wheat","offer_id":39331406741570,"sku":"9852011","price":630.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"For 1 Seater \/ Audo Cotlin - Poppy Seed","offer_id":39331406774338,"sku":"9852012","price":630.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"For 2 Seater \/ Audo Cotlin - Oat","offer_id":39331406807106,"sku":"9853010","price":980.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"For 2 Seater \/ Audo Cotlin - Wheat","offer_id":39331406839874,"sku":"9853011","price":980.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"For 2 Seater \/ Audo Cotlin - Poppy Seed","offer_id":39331406872642,"sku":"9853012","price":980.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"For 3 Seater \/ Audo Cotlin - Oat","offer_id":39331406905410,"sku":"9854010","price":1100.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"For 3 Seater \/ Audo Cotlin - Wheat","offer_id":39331406938178,"sku":"9854011","price":1100.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"For 3 Seater \/ Audo Cotlin - Poppy Seed","offer_id":39331406970946,"sku":"9854012","price":1100.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/MenuMay2021-Day20998_2ab5595c-1e6a-4d5a-8032-b55b93e6d902.jpg?v=1660653105","url":"https:\/\/audocph.com\/products\/offset-loose-cover","provider":"Audo Copenhagen","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
