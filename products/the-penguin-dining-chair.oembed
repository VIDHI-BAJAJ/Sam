{"product_id":"the-penguin-dining-chair","title":"The Penguin Dining Chair","description":"\u003cp\u003eLight, elegant, sculptural and artistic, the Penguin Dining Chair is a rare Danish Modern icon designed by Danish furniture designer Ib Kofod-Larsen in 1953. When it was launched in the United States, the chair was also called the Ib Kofod-Larsen Chair – and has therefore become Kofod-Larsen’s signature. The proportions with the slightly oversize seat and back, the large organically shaped shell in contrast to the petite, slender frame have a naivety about them. But at the same time, The Penguin Dining Chair is a sophisticated, bold chair with plenty of personality – an all-round chair, but anything but ordinary. Its penguin-shaped flippers on the back of the chair are typical of Ib Kofod-Larsen’s simple and honest aesthetics. The back moulds its way into the body to ensure comfort and support as well as a unique sitting experience. The Penguin Dining Chair is perfect for both the home and public spaces.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Ib Kofod-Larsen","offers":[{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Re-Wool 218","offer_id":39718565150786,"sku":"1200001-010000ZZ","price":805.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Re-Wool 448","offer_id":39718565183554,"sku":"1200001-010100ZZ","price":805.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Hallingdal 65 0110","offer_id":39718565216322,"sku":"1200002-000000ZZ","price":830.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Hallingdal 65 600","offer_id":39718565249090,"sku":"1200002-000100ZZ","price":830.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Dakar 0250","offer_id":39718566166594,"sku":"1200005-010000ZZ","price":965.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Dakar 0329","offer_id":39718566199362,"sku":"1200005-010100ZZ","price":965.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Dakar 0842","offer_id":39718566232130,"sku":"1200005-010200ZZ","price":965.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Natural Oak","offer_id":39752127774786,"sku":"1201025","price":565.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Walnut \/ Re-Wool 218","offer_id":39718565281858,"sku":"1201001-010000ZZ","price":845.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Walnut \/ Re-Wool 448","offer_id":39718565314626,"sku":"1201001-010100ZZ","price":845.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Walnut \/ Hallingdal 65 0110","offer_id":39718565347394,"sku":"1201002-000000ZZ","price":885.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Walnut \/ Hallingdal 65 600","offer_id":39718565380162,"sku":"1201002-000100ZZ","price":885.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Walnut \/ Dakar 0250","offer_id":39718566264898,"sku":"1201005-000000ZZ","price":1035.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Walnut \/ Dakar 0329","offer_id":39718566297666,"sku":"1201005-000100ZZ","price":1035.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Walnut \/ Dakar 0842","offer_id":39718566330434,"sku":"1201005-000200ZZ","price":1035.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Walnut \/ Walnut","offer_id":39752127807554,"sku":"1201026","price":695.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/MENU_The_Penguin_Dining_Chair_Androgyne_Dining_Table.jpg?v=1664271229","url":"https:\/\/audocph.com\/products\/the-penguin-dining-chair","provider":"Audo Copenhagen","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
