{"product_id":"tired-man","title":"The Tired Man Lounge Chair, Sheepskin","description":"\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eThe Tired Man was launched at the Copenhagen Cabinetmakers’ Guild Exhibition in 1935 and has since become an icon of Danish design. The epitome of craftsmanship and comfort, the characteristically curved armchair was designed by Flemming Lassen to feel “as warm and snug as a polar bear cub in the arms of its mother.” Relaunched in 2015, the award-winning design is offered in plush upholstery, including sheepskin in a nod to the original, and with natural or dark-oiled oak heartwood legs and front brass casters for easy movement. A corresponding footstool ensures further comfort.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Flemming Lassen","offers":[{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Sheepskin Moonlight","offer_id":40130029584450,"sku":"1500007-010E02ZZ","price":9155.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Natural Oak \/ Sheepskin Honey","offer_id":40130029617218,"sku":"1500007-010G02ZZ","price":9155.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dark Stained Oak \/ Sheepskin Moonlight","offer_id":40130029649986,"sku":"1500007-050E02ZZ","price":9155.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dark Stained Oak \/ Sheepskin Honey","offer_id":40130029682754,"sku":"1500007-050G02ZZ","price":9155.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/MENU_The_Tired_Man_Rond_Bowl_Converge_Book_Ends.jpg?v=1675773981","url":"https:\/\/audocph.com\/products\/tired-man","provider":"Audo Copenhagen","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
