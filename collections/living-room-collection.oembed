The result is Nimbus, a refreshingly simple mirror in bronzed brass and light-reflecting glass which defines a space with its soothing and sophisticated round shape. A mirror isn’t merely purely functional: since ancient times, they have reflected the style of a period—framed by ornate Baroque flourishes or Gothic arches and the simple lines of the Bauhaus movement. Audo’s latest iteration takes the fundamentals of the mirror into the modern age, yet with a mythological twist, referenced in its name: in Greek mythology, Nimbus was a shining cloud or corona that often surrounded a deity when on Earth. Design studio Krøyer-Sætter-Lassen looked to the way in which a painting or picture is framed to change the overall expression of the artwork. Encompassed by a halo-like bronzed brass ring, held in place by decorative screws, the circular mirror adds to the sense of light and space in a room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Kroyer-Saetter-Lassen","offers":[{"title":"Polished Brass","offer_id":31864471322690,"sku":"8032839","price":1125.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Bronzed Brass","offer_id":31864471355458,"sku":"8032859","price":1125.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/MENU_Eave-Modular-Sofa_Nimbus-Mirror_Echasse-Vase.jpg?v=1685354812"},{"product_id":"hashira-pendant-lamp-cluster","title":"Hashira Pendant Lamp, Cluster","description":"\u003cp\u003eA trio of pendants suspended from a black textile cord create the collection’s cluster light, bringing the same sense of understated luxury and calm to interior spaces as the other designs in the collection.

The inner cushion is made from 100% recycled polyester filler that is originally derived from plastic bottles. The cover of the inner cushion is also made from polyester, ensuring the product is mono-material. The prevalence of mono-materials in the Losaria Pillow means that at the end of its long life, the wool cover and recycled polyester inner cushion may be reused once again.
