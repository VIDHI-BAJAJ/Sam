Crafted with care from natural wool fibers, up close its soft loops – alternating in size – evoke the feeling of walking on a pebbled beach, but from far away the surface of the rug appears to ripple like a cornfield swaying with the wind. The tactile surface is achieved using a technique whereby tonal wool yarns of varying sizes are looped into tufts. The natural material softens the rug’s overall expression, which will work in any context, from private homes to public spaces.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Nina Bruun","offers":[{"title":"170x240 cm \/ Ivory","offer_id":40193229520962,"sku":"5852649","price":1275.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"200x300 cm \/ Ivory","offer_id":31864482431042,"sku":"5851649","price":1420.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"200x300 cm \/ Grey","offer_id":47955069010250,"sku":"5851139","price":1420.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/BI9A8035.jpg?v=1692956018"},{"product_id":"houkime-rug","title":"Houkime Rug Beige","description":"\u003cp\u003eDesigned by Nina Bruun, the Houkime Rug is classic in its expression, woven in a ribbed pattern from plush cotton and tencel for a tactile finish.
