Crafted out of aluminium for 100% recyclability, durability and lightness, the lamp’s sphere\/shade, meanwhile, is made from injected plastic, offering long-term durability and safety (both for the lamp and user). Its design is the result of a reduction process that focused on adding in all necessary parts without adding too much. Rather, by omitting superfluous or decorative elements, only its function gives it its formal language.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhare transforms into a daily companion that can be freely placed, hung or taken outside as long as conditions are dry according to need. Whether standing or hanging, Phare is not a lamp to be utilized in merely one spot, but celebrated for its versatility. It’s simple good taste and composition will suit all residences – from Le Corbusier’s establishment to a contemporary, urban flat, Phare stands in opposition to the planned obsolescence of products to serve and live longer.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ci\u003eImportant usage information: To keep the internal battery healthy, only leave the Phare lamp plugged in during charging, with the lamp off.
