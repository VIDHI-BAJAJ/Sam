Looking to the world of architecture, the neat, precisionmade piece conveys a sense of serene practicality. With multiple functions – as a desk, counter or shelf to store books, hung at any height you choose – it lends itself to almost any setting and fits neatly into living areas as well as bedrooms where space is at a premium. The minimalist steel bracket attaches to a wall and takes its cues from the handrail of a staircase. The wooden platform, available in natural or stained oak, provides a tactile contrast to the precision metalwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Neat.
