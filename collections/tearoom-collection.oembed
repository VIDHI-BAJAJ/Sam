Ross’ inspiration for the design came from Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s Willow Chair, created for the Willow Tearooms in Glasgow in 1904. Like many of Mackintosh’s furniture designs, the Willow Chair – while undoubtedly beautiful – is more about visual impact than comfort, its unusual dimensions making it more of a sculptural installation than a piece of usable furniture. Seeing untapped potential, Ross opted to evolve the essence of the Willow Chair to create a more fully resolved product.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Nick Ross","offers":[{"title":"Savanna - 202","offer_id":31864573231170,"sku":"9600002-002C0BZZ","price":2175.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Champion - 035","offer_id":39247079276610,"sku":"9600001-000100ZZ","price":1930.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Audo Bouclé 02","offer_id":39348859600962,"sku":"9600020-000300ZZ","price":1715.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/MENU-Tearoom_Club_Chair-2.jpg?v=1587485562"},{"product_id":"tearoom-lounge-chair-high-back","title":"Tearoom, Lounge Chair, High Back","description":"\u003cp\u003eWhile creating the clean silhouettes of the Tearoom Collection, designer Nick Ross took exceptional care to imbue every inch of each design with mood-lifting comfort.
