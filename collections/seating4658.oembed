Ross’ inspiration for the design came from Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s Willow Chair, created for the Willow Tearooms in Glasgow in 1904. Like many of Mackintosh’s furniture designs, the Willow Chair – while undoubtedly beautiful – is more about visual impact than comfort, its unusual dimensions making it more of a sculptural installation than a piece of usable furniture. Seeing untapped potential, Ross opted to evolve the essence of the Willow Chair to create a more fully resolved product.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Nick Ross","offers":[{"title":"Savanna - 202","offer_id":31864573231170,"sku":"9600002-002C0BZZ","price":2175.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Champion - 035","offer_id":39247079276610,"sku":"9600001-000100ZZ","price":1930.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Audo Bouclé 02","offer_id":39348859600962,"sku":"9600020-000300ZZ","price":1715.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/MENU-Tearoom_Club_Chair-2.jpg?v=1587485562"},{"product_id":"studio-wm-string-lounge-chair-2-pack","title":"WM String Lounge Chair","description":"\u003cp\u003eWendy Legro and Maarten Collignon are the founders of Studio WM - a design studio based in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuided by all senses, their mission is to create seemingly simple designs that reflect the love that is put into them - and their details - for years to come.

When it was launched in the United States, the chair was also called the Ib Kofod-Larsen Chair – and has therefore become Kofod-Larsen’s signature. The proportions with the slightly oversize seat and back, the large organically shaped shell in contrast to the petite, slender frame have a naivety about them. But at the same time, The Penguin Dining Chair is a sophisticated, bold chair with plenty of personality – an all-round chair, but anything but ordinary. Its penguin-shaped flippers on the back of the chair are typical of Ib Kofod-Larsen’s simple and honest aesthetics. The back moulds its way into the body to ensure comfort and support as well as a unique sitting experience.

The chair's construction is characterized by an open design, featuring a curved back and seat upholstered in fabric or leather, all held together by a sturdy steel frame. This chair, created by furniture designer Ib Kofod-Larsen in 1953, embodies Danish cultural heritage and design history. With its elegant silhouette, sculptural form, and organic lines and curves, it remains a contemporary masterpiece that resonates even more strongly in the present.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Ib Kofod-Larsen","offers":[{"title":"Re-wool 218","offer_id":46869694284106,"sku":"1231001-000400ZZ","price":1595.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Re-wool 448","offer_id":46869694316874,"sku":"1231001-000800ZZ","price":1595.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Hallingdal 65 0110","offer_id":46869694349642,"sku":"1231002-000200ZZ","price":1635.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Hallingdal 65 600","offer_id":46869694382410,"sku":"1231002-000X00ZZ","price":1635.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dakar 0250","offer_id":46869694415178,"sku":"1231005-000300ZZ","price":1825.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dakar 0329","offer_id":46869694447946,"sku":"1231005-000700ZZ","price":1825.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dakar 0842","offer_id":46869694480714,"sku":"1231005-000T00ZZ","price":1825.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/files\/Audo_Penguin_Rocking_Chair_111_37d70e58-802c-498e-b713-450fec606bab.jpg?v=1691146864"},{"product_id":"eave-modular-sofa-96-corner-144","title":"Eave Modular Sofa, 96, Corner 144","description":"\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eAllowing for total customisation of living and lounging spaces, the Eave Modular Sofa comes in a wide variety of seating modules as well as preconfigured designs.
