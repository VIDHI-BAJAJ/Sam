The result is Nimbus, a refreshingly simple mirror in bronzed brass and light-reflecting glass which defines a space with its soothing and sophisticated round shape. A mirror isn’t merely purely functional: since ancient times, they have reflected the style of a period—framed by ornate Baroque flourishes or Gothic arches and the simple lines of the Bauhaus movement. Audo’s latest iteration takes the fundamentals of the mirror into the modern age, yet with a mythological twist, referenced in its name: in Greek mythology, Nimbus was a shining cloud or corona that often surrounded a deity when on Earth. Design studio Krøyer-Sætter-Lassen looked to the way in which a painting or picture is framed to change the overall expression of the artwork. Encompassed by a halo-like bronzed brass ring, held in place by decorative screws, the circular mirror adds to the sense of light and space in a room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Kroyer-Saetter-Lassen","offers":[{"title":"Polished Brass","offer_id":31864471322690,"sku":"8032839","price":1125.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Bronzed Brass","offer_id":31864471355458,"sku":"8032859","price":1125.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/MENU_Eave-Modular-Sofa_Nimbus-Mirror_Echasse-Vase.jpg?v=1685354812"},{"product_id":"nimbus-mirror","title":"Nimbus Mirror, Ø110","description":"\u003cp\u003eLooking to the way in which a picture or a painting is framed, the Copenhagen based design studio krøyer-sætter-lassen investigated how an entire frame could surround a mirror without detracting from the beauty and reflection of the glass.The result is nimbus, a refreshingly simple mirror in bronzed or polished brass and light-reflecting glass which defines a space with its soothing and sophisticated round shape.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSurrounded with a bronzed or polished solid brass frame, held in place with decorative screws, the Nimbus mirror measures 110 cm in diameter, making it ideal as a functional object, as well as a decorative addition to homes, hotels or offices.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Kroyer-Saetter-Lassen","offers":[{"title":"Polished Brass","offer_id":31864483381314,"sku":"8031839","price":1125.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Bronzed Brass","offer_id":31864483414082,"sku":"8031859","price":1125.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/MENU_Nimbus-Mirror.jpg?v=1685354865"},{"product_id":"tr-bulb-suspension-frame","title":"TR Bulb, Suspension Frame","description":"\u003cp\u003eTR Bulb is a clever solution for modern city living, inspired by the way people are increasingly becoming urban nomads, moving between cities and countries to pursue careers and life experiences.
