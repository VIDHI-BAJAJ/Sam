{"title":"Afteroom Chair Collection","description":"A study of the unity between functionalism and minimalism, the Afteroom series looks to the simple, geometric lines of the Bauhaus design movement to create furniture and interior objects pared back to their purest forms. The Stockholm-based Taiwanese design team Afteroom was tasked with creating iconic furniture designs that were both minimalist and comfortable — and with a silhouette that was both sleek and instantly recognisable. Defined by this ‘less is more’ aesthetic, MENU’s Afteroom series profiles honest materials on an elegant collection of furniture with lasting appeal.","products":[{"product_id":"afteroom-stool-veneer","title":"Afteroom Stool, Veneer","description":"\u003cdiv class=\"page\" title=\"Page 35\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"layoutArea\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"column\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith its characteristic clean lines and sturdy base in tubular black powder-coated steel, tethered with cross bars for support, the Afteroom Stool comes in three heights, making it easy to slide up to a bar, counter or table.
