The result is Nimbus, a refreshingly simple mirror in bronzed brass and light-reflecting glass which defines a space with its soothing and sophisticated round shape. A mirror isn’t merely purely functional: since ancient times, they have reflected the style of a period—framed by ornate Baroque flourishes or Gothic arches and the simple lines of the Bauhaus movement. Audo’s latest iteration takes the fundamentals of the mirror into the modern age, yet with a mythological twist, referenced in its name: in Greek mythology, Nimbus was a shining cloud or corona that often surrounded a deity when on Earth. Design studio Krøyer-Sætter-Lassen looked to the way in which a painting or picture is framed to change the overall expression of the artwork.

The focus on materials and quality makes the Pepe Marble Mirror timeless. The Pepe Marble Mirror, designed by Milan-based firm Studiopepe, is an elegant study of functionality overlapping with aesthetic. The Pepe was previously only available as a standing mirror and is now available in a wall-mounted option. This makes it perfect for small spaces and spaces where you don’t want items to be moveable, such as restaurant bathrooms or hotel rooms. One side of the mirror offers regular reflection, while the other shows magnification of 300%; a perfect mirror for self-grooming.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"panel-group productAccordins\" id=\"accordion\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"panel panel-default\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"panelAccordinHeader\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"panelAccordinHeaderIcons\"\u003e\u003ca data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"https:\/\/audocph.com\/en\/pepe-marble-mirror-wall-brass-black\/#collapse1\" class=\"collapsed\"\u003e\u003ci class=\"fa fa-plus\"\u003e\u003c\/i\u003e\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e","brand":"Studiopepe","offers":[{"title":"Brass | White Marble","offer_id":32297009578050,"sku":"3610639","price":510.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Brass | Honed Brown Marble","offer_id":32297009610818,"sku":"3610939","price":510.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Brass | Black Marble","offer_id":32302663499842,"sku":"3610539","price":510.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/MENU_Pepe-Mirror-wall-7.jpg?v=1678881977"},{"product_id":"torso-table-lamp-57","title":"Torso Table Lamp, 57","description":"\u003cp\u003eThe transformative powers of light come into play on the Torso Table Lamp by Krøyer-Sætter-Lassen, designed with a timeless look that lends itself to any setting.

To create the cover, a soft mix of Italian pure and bouclé wool is woven together with silk giving the pillows an elegant, classic pattern. The inner cushion is made from 100% recycled polyester filler that is originally derived from plastic bottles. The cover of the inner cushion is also made from polyester, ensuring the product is mono-material. The prevalence of mono-materials in the Losaria Pillow means that at the end of its long life, the wool cover and recycled polyester inner cushion may be reused once again.

The proportions with the slightly oversize seat and back, the large organically shaped shell in contrast to the petite, slender frame have a naivety about them. But at the same time, The Penguin Dining Chair is a sophisticated, bold chair with plenty of personality – an all-round chair, but anything but ordinary. Its penguin-shaped flippers on the back of the chair are typical of Ib Kofod-Larsen’s simple and honest aesthetics. The back moulds its way into the body to ensure comfort and support as well as a unique sitting experience.
