Crafted out of aluminium for 100% recyclability, durability and lightness, the lamp’s sphere\/shade, meanwhile, is made from injected plastic, offering long-term durability and safety (both for the lamp and user). Its design is the result of a reduction process that focused on adding in all necessary parts without adding too much.
