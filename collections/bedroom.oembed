The result is Nimbus, a refreshingly simple mirror in bronzed brass and light-reflecting glass which defines a space with its soothing and sophisticated round shape. A mirror isn’t merely purely functional: since ancient times, they have reflected the style of a period—framed by ornate Baroque flourishes or Gothic arches and the simple lines of the Bauhaus movement. Audo’s latest iteration takes the fundamentals of the mirror into the modern age, yet with a mythological twist, referenced in its name: in Greek mythology, Nimbus was a shining cloud or corona that often surrounded a deity when on Earth. Design studio Krøyer-Sætter-Lassen looked to the way in which a painting or picture is framed to change the overall expression of the artwork. Encompassed by a halo-like bronzed brass ring, held in place by decorative screws, the circular mirror adds to the sense of light and space in a room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Kroyer-Saetter-Lassen","offers":[{"title":"Polished Brass","offer_id":31864471322690,"sku":"8032839","price":1125.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Bronzed Brass","offer_id":31864471355458,"sku":"8032859","price":1125.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/MENU_Eave-Modular-Sofa_Nimbus-Mirror_Echasse-Vase.jpg?v=1685354812"},{"product_id":"hashira-pendant-lamp","title":"Hashira Pendant Lamp","description":"\u003cp\u003eThe collection’s pendant light is created with the same column-like shape as the floor and table lamp, carefully covered with translucent fabric that reveals the graphic structure within and suspended from the ceiling by a textile cord.
