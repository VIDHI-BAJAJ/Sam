Now considered a collector’s item, the ML42 was first designed in 1942. Shaped from wood to support the body, it is offered in three different heights, each featuring a moulded seat and tripod-like legs. The addition of a metal foot bar on the bar and counter versions ensures further comfort when seated for extended periods. Lightweight and easy to move around, it is offered in black-stained beech, soap treated oak and brown-oiled oak.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Mogens Lassen","offers":[{"title":"Black Stained Beech \/ Stainless Steel","offer_id":46824472379722,"sku":"BL41013","price":910.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Black Stained Beech \/ Brass","offer_id":40190270013506,"sku":"BL41023","price":910.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Black Stained Beech \/ Copper","offer_id":40190269980738,"sku":"BL41043","price":860.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Soap Treated Oak \/ Stainless Steel","offer_id":40190270046274,"sku":"BL41113","price":1260.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Soap Treated Oak \/ Brass","offer_id":40190270079042,"sku":"BL41123","price":1260.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Soap Treated Oak \/ Copper","offer_id":46824482963786,"sku":"BL41143","price":1220.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Brown Oiled Oak \/ Stainless Steel","offer_id":40190270111810,"sku":"BL41413","price":1260.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Brown Oiled Oak \/ Brass","offer_id":40190270144578,"sku":"BL41423","price":1260.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Brown Oiled Oak \/ Copper","offer_id":46824499151178,"sku":"BL41443","price":1220.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/bylassen_ML42_Stool_ML42_Counter_Stool_ML42_Bar_Stool.jpg?v=1676017296"},{"product_id":"ml-42-counter-stool","title":"ML 42 Counter Stool","description":"\u003cp\u003eIn 1942 Mogens Lassen designed the Stool ML42 as a piece for a furniture exhibition held at the Danish Museum of Decorative Art.
