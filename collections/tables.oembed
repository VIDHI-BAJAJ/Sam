In other words, a design with a strong profile – yet the ability to work in harmony with surroundings of all styles.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Harbour Column Table features a simple tabletop paired with a subtle yet sophisticated clover-shaped column profile: the same one you’ll see in the new swivel version of the Harbour Chair. The pairing gives the modern design a classic, exclusive feel. While the table was originally designed for the Harbour Chair, it also works beautifully with other seating types and styles. At the heart of the Harbour family, after all, is a desire to meet our constantly evolving needs with adaptability and grace.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Audo House – Audo’s testing ground for new products and a creative hub that’s part office, part café, and part co-working space – the Harbour Column Table has demonstrated an exceptional ability to meet every functional demand, while also pleasing the senses with its balanced, slim silhouette and tactility. The table is available with both round and rectangular tabletops, and in three heights – so finding the right one for your space is easy. You just might wonder how you managed without it.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Harbour Column Table is available with four tabletop sizes: three round, one rectangular. Each can be crafted in charcoal linoleum, black oak veneer, or off white marblento suit your space and design preferences. The column base is constructed in steel and aluminum in a black powder-coated finish, with dining, counter and bar heights to fit numerous needs in homes, workplaces, cafés, lobbies – the possibilities are endless. Mix and match bases and tabletops to create your ideal pairing.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Norm Architects","offers":[{"title":"Dining \/ 60 cm \/ Black | Kunis Breccia","offer_id":31864463917122,"sku":"9326139","price":1360.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dining \/ 60 cm \/ Black | Charcoal Linoleum","offer_id":31864463949890,"sku":"9326149","price":865.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dining \/ 60 cm \/ Black | Black Oak","offer_id":31864463982658,"sku":"9326539","price":865.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dining \/ 60 cm \/ Black | Estremoz Marble","offer_id":31864464015426,"sku":"9326659","price":1160.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dining \/ 80 cm \/ Black | Kunis Breccia","offer_id":31864464048194,"sku":"9327139","price":1535.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dining \/ 80 cm \/ Black | Charcoal Linoleum","offer_id":31864464080962,"sku":"9327149","price":1040.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dining \/ 80 cm \/ Black | Black Oak","offer_id":31864464113730,"sku":"9327539","price":1040.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Dining \/ 80 cm \/ Black | Estremoz Marble","offer_id":31864464146498,"sku":"9327659","price":1335.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Counter \/ 60 cm \/ Black | Kunis Breccia","offer_id":31864464179266,"sku":"9331139","price":1345.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Counter \/ 60 cm \/ Black | Charcoal Linoleum","offer_id":31864464212034,"sku":"9331149","price":850.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Counter \/ 60 cm \/ Black | Black Oak","offer_id":31864464244802,"sku":"9331539","price":850.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Counter \/ 60 cm \/ Black | Estremoz Marble","offer_id":31864464277570,"sku":"9331659","price":1145.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Counter \/ 80 cm \/ Black | Kunis Breccia","offer_id":31864464310338,"sku":"9332139","price":1520.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Counter \/ 80 cm \/ Black | Charcoal Linoleum","offer_id":31864464343106,"sku":"9332149","price":1025.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Counter \/ 80 cm \/ Black | Black Oak","offer_id":31864464375874,"sku":"9332539","price":1025.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Counter \/ 80 cm \/ Black | Estremoz Marble","offer_id":31864464408642,"sku":"9332659","price":1320.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Bar \/ 60 cm \/ Black | Kunis Breccia","offer_id":31864464441410,"sku":"9336139","price":1345.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Bar \/ 60 cm \/ Black | Charcoal Linoleum","offer_id":31864464474178,"sku":"9336149","price":850.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Bar \/ 60 cm \/ Black | Black Oak","offer_id":31864464506946,"sku":"9336539","price":850.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Bar \/ 60 cm \/ Black | Estremoz Marble","offer_id":31864464539714,"sku":"9336659","price":1145.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Bar \/ 80 cm \/ Black | Kunis Breccia","offer_id":31864464572482,"sku":"9337139","price":1520.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Bar \/ 80 cm \/ Black | Charcoal Linoleum","offer_id":31864464605250,"sku":"9337149","price":1025.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Bar \/ 80 cm \/ Black | Black Oak","offer_id":31864464638018,"sku":"9337539","price":1025.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true},{"title":"Bar \/ 80 cm \/ Black | Estremoz Marble","offer_id":31864464670786,"sku":"9337659","price":1320.0,"currency_code":"EUR","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0262\/3959\/8658\/products\/MENU_WM_String_Dining_Chair_Harbour_Column_Table_Ray_Table_Lamp_8c8eeb44-c7f0-484a-a565-ff84bff998e4.jpg?v=1664978228"},{"product_id":"rail-desk","title":"Rail Desk","description":"\u003cp\u003eAudo’s new Rail Desk, imagined by Japanese designer Keiji Ashizawa, explores the way in which we use space and how design elements can be adapted to serve different functions.
